       What are the benefits of Arjun Leaf for Angina (heart-related chest pain)?<br/>
        <br/>
        Arjun leaf is beneficial in the management of chest pain (angina). Studies suggest that the bark of Arjuna shows a significant reduction in chest pain by lowering the level of cortisol i.e., the stress hormone. Arjuna also increases exercise tolerance, improves HDL levels and reduces blood pressure in people with stable angina<br/><br/>Arjun leaf is useful to reduce the risk of heart problems like angina. Angina is due to an aggravated Kapha but the pain associated with it is a symptom of aggravated Vata. An aggravated Kapha leads to the production of Ama (toxic remains in the body due to improper digestion) in the body. This Ama accumulates in the heart channels and causes a blockage leading to an aggravated Vata. This causes pain in the chest area. Arjuna has Kapha balancing property. It helps to reduce Ama, removes the blockage of heart channels and calms the aggravated Vata. This helps reduce chest pain.<br/><br/>Tips for taking Arjun leaf
 <br/>1. Take10- 20- ml of Arjuna kwath or as directed by the Physician.
<br/>2. Add the same quantity of milk or water to it.
<br/>3. Drink once or twice a day after food to reduce the risk of chest pain.

       What are Curry Leaves?
 <br/><br/>Curry leaves are the curry tree foliage (Murraya koenigii). This tree is native to India, and for both medicinal and culinary purposes, its leaves are used. They are particularly aromatic and have a distinctive taste of citrus notes. In Indian households, curry leaves, the quintessential aromatic element, have countless nutritional and therapeutic benefits. Kadi Patta or Meetha Neem in Hindi, Kariveppilai in Tamil, or Karivempu in Malayalam are known by many vernacular names as this tree is indigenous to India, Srilanka, and many Southeast Asian countries. Although this traditional spice mixture is often added and popularly used in cooking to add flavor to dishes such as curries, rice dishes, and dals, curry leaves are not the same as curry powder. They deliver an array of health benefits due to the strong plant compounds they produce, apart from being a versatile culinary herb.

 <br/><br/>Nutritional Value of Curry Leaves
 <br/>These high-speed deciduous shrubs are a compulsory part of Indian cooking where all the dishes for seasoning or garnishing start and end with it. Curry leaves are very rich in copper, minerals, calcium, phosphorous, fiber, carbohydrates, magnesium, and iron, which are important nutrients.

 <br/><br/>Besides, curry leaves often contain different kinds of vitamins and amino acids. Depending on the intended use, the leaves can be dried or fried, and the fresh form is very common as well.

     Medicinal Uses and Indications Treatment
 <br/>Venous insufficiency and varicose veins

 <br/><br/>When blood vessels lose their elasticity, blood pools in the legs and fluid leaks out of the blood vessels. That causes the legs to swell (venous insufficiency). Several small studies suggest gotu kola may help reduce swelling and improve blood flow. In a study of 94 people with venous insufficiency, those who took gotu kola saw their symptoms improve compared to those who took a placebo.

 <br/><br/>One study also found that people who took gotu kola before flying had less ankle and leg swelling than those who did not take it.

 <br/><br/>Wound healing and skin lesions

 <br/><br/>Gotu kola has chemicals called triterpenoids. In animal and lab studies, these compounds seem to help heal wounds. For example, some studies suggest that triterpenoids strengthen the skin, boost antioxidants in wounds, and increase blood supply to the area. Based on these findings, gotu kola has been applied to the skin, or used topically, for minor burns, psoriasis, preventing scars after surgery, and preventing or reducing stretch marks.

You can find gotu kola in many creams for wound healing. Ask your health care provider if one is right for you.

       Health Benefits of Mint
Traditional medicine uses mint to treat a variety of ailments. 
</br>Unfortunately, there aren't many human studies documenting the impact mint has on the body apart from digestion support and irritable bowel syndrome relief.
</br> With time, research could confirm that mint is useful in treating a wider variety of illnesses.</br></br>
Mint is perhaps most popularly known as a remedy for digestive problems.</br>
 Some limited research suggests that peppermint oil in capsules may ease belly pain from irritable bowel syndrome. 

Animal and in vitro studies suggest that mint leaves could have wider medicinal uses than those currently known.</br>
 These types of studies have found that mint is able to kill bacteria, reduce stress, and fight cancerous tumor cells. </br>
 Human trials will be required to determine if mint also has these effects on the human body.

       Kidney Stones
  <br/><br/>One of the most popular traditional uses for the Leaf of Life is to treat kidney stones.
   <br/> While research has not gotten to the stage of human testing, there are some animal tests that show that the plant may have a positive effect on kidney stones.
    <br/> A study conducted in 2014 showed that rats given a treatment containing plant extracts were less likely to develop kidney stones. <br/>
    Those rats given the treatment had reduced levels of urine oxalates, and those oxalates are typically what causes kidney stones.<br/><br/>
Pregnancy
<br/><br/>In recent years, studies have been conducted that show that the Leaf of Life may be beneficial for women who are pregnant.
<br/> An animal study conducted in 2014 administered different dosages of Bryophyllum pinnatum extracts to pregnant rats.<br/>
 The results showed that the plant extracts interfered with maternal weight gain, and there were no adverse effects on both the mothers and their fetuses. <br/>
 In the same year, a study was also conducted on human subjects. <br/>
 Pregnant women suffering from sleep issues were given 350 mg tablets that were 50 percent composed of B. pinnatum. <br/>
 At the end of the study, the women reported experiencing fewer wake-ups and an improved quality of sleep.<br/>
   In this study, no adverse effects were reported either.
<br/><br/>Sinus
Traditional use commonly dictates that the Leaf of Life be used to treat colds and improve sinus pressure.<br/>
 Although this use has not be scientifically tested yet, many people claim it can treat much more than simple colds and sinusitis.<br/>
   However, an in vitro study conducted in 2007 showed that the plant extract contains compounds that may act as an antimicrobial.<br/>
     This may explain why the Leaf of Life works so well for the treatment of colds and sinus conditions. <br/>
     A simple tea made from the leaves or the extracts from the Leaf of Life can be used to treat bronchitis, shortness of breath, coughs, nasal congestion, and asthma (see section below).
<br/><br/>Hair
The Leaf of Life is commonly used to nourish the hair and treat gray hair; however, this has not been tested in a controlled setting yet.<br/>
 Many claim that if you use the extracts from the leaves of the plant, it both prevents grey hair from growing and it may promote a healthy scalp.<br/>
   Although people believe the extracts help with hair care, the mechanisms that make it work are still unknown.<br/><br/>
Asthma
Several animal studies have been conducted over the years that support the use of the Leaf of Life as an anti-asthmatic medicine.<br/>
 For example, a study conducted in 2013 treated guinea pigs over a period of 21 days using an extract dosage of either 200 or 400 mg per kg od body weight per day. <br/>
 Over the course of the study, the rodents were exposed to a throat irritant.<br/>
   At the end of the study, the guinea pigs had reduced mucus viscosity, supporting the plants use as an anti-asthmatic.<br/>
     In addition to this study, several of the studies that support its use as an antimicrobial agent also suggests that this antimicrobial activity is what makes the plant effective in treating asthma.

<br/><br/>Diabetes
In 2008 a study was conducted that suggested that Bryophyllum pinnatum may support anti-diabetic activity.<br/>
 In this study, diabetic rats were given dosages of either 200, 400, or 800 mg per kg body weight per day.<br/>
   All dosages were shown to be effective in lowering blood sugar in the diabetic rats, and the treatment also reduced the levels of triglycerides.<br/>
     Another scientific investigation in 2014 was also conducted on rats which duplicated these results.<br/>
       From these two studies, it appears that the anti-diabetic properties of the Leaf of Life deserve further study as they may significantly benefit people suffering from diabetes.

Skin
As mentioned previously, the Leaf of Life also has anti-microbial compounds that help with the treatment of sinuses and asthma. However, this anti-microbial activity may also benefit the skin and treat minor injuries. In fact, many traditional uses dictate that the plant be used for this purpose. Applying a poultice to injuries helps to ease pain, promote faster healing, and prevent infection. Numerous studies (aside from the two mentioned earlier) also support this notion. For example, a study conducted in 2000 showed that the leaves prevented the growth of 5/8 of the bacteria tested. Another study in 2012 isolated compounds from the plant that are known to have anti-microbial properties, confirming that it may be used to treat infections. More research still needs to be conducted (particularly clinical trials), but these initial pilot studies are very promising.
